## Game Development and Design

### Concept : 
The Game Scene has one player. To navigate through this scene, a player has to use the arrow keyboard keys. The player has to navigate through the Game scene to find and kill the monsters.
The more monsters you kill, the more you level up.
Dead monsters drop random objects.
### Characters :

Player :

* Warrior
* Tank
* Sorcerer

Monster :

* Slime
* Mage

### Non-player Characters:

* Old Man
